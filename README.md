# Weather App – COMP3123 Lab Test 2

This is a React-based weather application that was built as part of my **COMP3123 – Full Stack Development Lab Test 2**.

The app allows users to search for real-time weather information using a public API.

## 🌐 API Service Used

wttr.in (https://wttr.in)
A free, keyless weather API.

**Why wttr.in?**  

OpenWeatherMap keys (preferred) were experiencing delays during activation,  
so I used this alternative free public API instead.
